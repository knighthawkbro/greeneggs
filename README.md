What it can do:
- Create a linked list and perform functions as a datatype Set
- Create an Array and perform functions as a datatype Set
- Runs through a driver program adding fruit to a basket as both datatypes
- Runs through a seuss program that reads green eggs and ham and only adds the distinct words from the book.

How to build yourself:
- DL [Golang](https://golang.org/dl/)
- CD to greeneggs directory
- run ```go build greeneggs.go```
- remove other executable ```rm greeneggs```
- run ```.\greeneggs.go```
- conversly you can just run ```go run greeneggs.go``` for an instant execution of the program
- I think you may need to set your [$GOPATH](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH) and create a src folder within for go build to work
